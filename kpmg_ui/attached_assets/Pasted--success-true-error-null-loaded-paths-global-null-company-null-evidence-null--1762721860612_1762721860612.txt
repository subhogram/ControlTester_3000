"I currently do not have access to any uploaded files, as the provided context is empty. To proceed with a domain-wise understanding or analysis, you need to first upload the following types of files:  \n\n1. **Cybersecurity risk and control policies** (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, etc.).  \n2. **Company-specific policies, procedures, and guidelines** (e.g., internal IT protocols, access control rules).  \n3. **Security investigation log evidences** (e.g., firewall logs, intrusion detection system alerts, incident reports).  \n\nOnce uploaded, I can:  \n- Analyze policies for compliance gaps or risks.  \n- Map controls to domains (e.g., asset management, access control, cryptography).  \n- Generate reports on audit findings or remediation recommendations.  \n\nPlease upload the required files, and I’ll provide a structured, actionable analysis.  \n\n**Note**: If you have specific questions about cybersecurity frameworks, compliance, or log analysis, feel free to share them, but I’ll need the uploaded context to provide accurate insights."
